Can use BUGS, JAGS, STAN (NIMBLE) to do this.
We are implementing this ourselves for pedagogical purposes.

Example comes from
  Murali Haran, Penn State Dept. of Statistics
and is very nicely explained at
  http://sites.stat.psu.edu/~mharan/MCMCtut/MCMC.html
with supporting PDF files that explain the math and algorithm.

Gamma distribution
  different ways to parameterize it.
   alpha is shape
   beta is scale

Inverse Gamma random variable is a 1 / X where X is a Gamma random variable.


Use
  R CMD COMPILE mcmc.c
since we will be using routines from R's Rmath library for random number generation.
