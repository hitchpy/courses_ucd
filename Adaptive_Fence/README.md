**STAT250 final project**

-----

This is a direct copy from stat232B final project, implementing *Adaptive Fence* proposed by Professor Jiming Jiang in 
University of California at Davis. The only justification for my blatant copying is I have devoted the last two weeks time 
to figure out the detail of the methods, (I didn't do the proving part. ) implementing the algorithms, and writing up most
of the reports.

This repository contain the background papers, the programs for two different Adaptive Fence methods, the final reports.
